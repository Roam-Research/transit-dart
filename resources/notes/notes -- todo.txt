:section ToDo

   [] Support custom write handlers.

   [] Read-handlers.

   [] Build some tests where we convert all the way to JSON and confirm against
   the transit samples. Figure out how to integrate the testing that is part of
   transit-format.

   [] Time will need to be different for msgpack and verbose.

   [] Uuid is also different for msgpack.

:section Done

   [✓] Implement Keyword and Symbol and the rest of the scalar extension types.
   How will those eventually play with cljd?
